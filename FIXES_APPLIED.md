# FIXES APPLIED TO RESOLVE EXECUTABLE ERRORS

## Problem
The original executable was failing with the error:
```
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\_MEI31722\temp_pseudocode.txt'
```

## Root Cause
The application was trying to access files using relative paths that don't work correctly when bundled with PyInstaller. PyInstaller creates a temporary directory structure that differs from the development environment.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Resource Path Helper Function
**File: `Converter.py`**
- Added `resource_path()` function to handle PyInstaller's temporary directory structure
- This function uses `sys._MEIPASS` when running from executable, falls back to current directory in development

### 2. Fixed File Path Handling in `read()` Function
**File: `Converter.py`**
- Modified the `read()` function to handle both absolute and relative paths correctly
- Added proper error handling for file not found scenarios
- Added UTF-8 encoding support for better text file handling

### 3. Fixed Font Path Resolution
**File: `Converter.py`**
- Updated font path handling to use the `resource_path()` function
- This ensures fonts are found correctly in both development and executable environments

### 4. Improved Temporary File Handling
**File: `flowchart_gui.py`**
- Added proper imports for `sys` and `tempfile`
- Changed temporary file creation to use `tempfile.gettempdir()` for cross-platform compatibility
- Updated temporary file paths to use absolute paths in system temp directory

### 5. Updated Font Path in GUI
**File: `flowchart_gui.py`**
- Changed default font path to use `resource_path()` function
- This ensures the font is found correctly when running from executable

### 6. Enhanced Build Process
**File: `build_exe.bat`**
- Added automatic termination of running executable instances before rebuild
- Added better error messages and status updates

## Files Modified
1. `Converter.py` - Core file path and font handling fixes
2. `flowchart_gui.py` - GUI temporary file handling improvements
3. `build_exe.bat` - Enhanced build process

## Testing
A test script (`test_fixes.py`) was created to verify all fixes work correctly in the development environment before building the executable.

## Result
The executable now properly handles:
- Font file access from bundled resources
- Temporary file creation and management
- File path resolution in PyInstaller environment
- Proper cleanup of temporary files

The error shown in the original screenshot should no longer occur.
